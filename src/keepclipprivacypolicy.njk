  <h1>Keep Clip Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Keep Clip</strong> is a tool for collecting and organizing text
    snippets with full respect for your privacy. Here's how your data is
    handled:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All clips, tags, and context you save are stored
      <strong>locally</strong> on your device in a private database.
    </li>
    <li>
      The app does <strong>not</strong> collect personal data or send your
      clips to any server.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep Clip includes
      <strong>no advertising, analytics, or third-party tracking libraries</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The app requests internet access only to fetch metadata (like page
      titles) for links you choose to save.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your data stays on your device unless you choose to
      <strong>share or export</strong> it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Android's built-in backup system may back up the local database to
      your Google account, depending on your device settings.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Keep Clip is designed to give you full control over your saved text,
    with minimal permissions and no external data sharing.

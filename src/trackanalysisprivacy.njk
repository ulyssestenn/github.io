  <h1>Track Analysis Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Track Analysis</strong> is a personal tracking app designed with
    privacy in mind. Here's how your data is handled:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All data you enter—such as event type, details, and timestamps—is
      stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>No data is collected, transmitted, or stored by us.</li>
    <li>
      The app includes
      <strong>no advertising, no analytics, and no third-party integrations</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The only optional export is a CSV file saved in your app’s private
      storage. You may share it manually using Android's standard sharing
      options.
    </li>
    <li>
      The app does <strong>not</strong> request access to your location,
      contacts, network, or other device features.
    </li>
    <li>
      A disclaimer in the app reminds users that it is for personal use only
      and is <strong>not medical advice</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Android's built-in backup system may back up the local database to your Google account, depending on your device settings.
